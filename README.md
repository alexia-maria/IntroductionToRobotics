# Homework 2

This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue)of  an  RGB  LED  using  individual  potentiometers. 
Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red,Green, andBlue.  This control must leveragedigital electronics.  Specifically,you  need  to  read  the  potentiometer’s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  amapped value to the LED pins.

# Homework 3

This assignment involves simulating a 3-floor elevator control system using LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with Arduino. By the end of this task, you will gain experience in using button state change, implementing debouncing techniques, and coordinating multiple components to represent real-world scenarios.

# Homework 4

The  initial  position  should  be  on  the  DP.  The  currentposition always blinks (irrespective of the fact that the segment is on oroff).  Use the joystick to move from one position to neighbors (see table forcorresponding movement).  Short pressing the button toggles the segmentstate  from  ON  to  OFF  or  from  OFF  to  ON.  Long  pressing  the  buttonresets the entire display by turning all the segments OFF and moving thecurrent position to the decimal point.

# Homework 5

Using the 4 digit 7 segment display and 3 buttons,you should implement a stopwatch timer that counts in 10ths of a secondand has a save lap functionality (similar to most basic stopwatch functionson most phones).

# Homework 6

Develop a ”Smart Environment Monitor and Logger” using Arduino.  This sys-tem will utilize various sensors to gather environmental data, log this data intoEEPROM, and provide both visual feedback via an RGB LED and user interaction through a Serial Menu.  The project focuses on integrating sensor readings,memory management, Serial Communication and the general objective of build-ing a menu.
