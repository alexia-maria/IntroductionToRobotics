# Homework 2

This assignment focuses on controlling each channel (Red, Green, and Blue)of  an  RGB  LED  using  individual  potentiometers. 
Use a separate potentiometer for controlling each color of the RGB LED:Red,Green, andBlue.  This control must leveragedigital electronics.  Specifically,you  need  to  read  the  potentiometerâ€™s  value  with  Arduino  and  then  write  amapped value to the LED pins.

# Homework 3

This assignment involves simulating a 3-floor elevator control system using LEDs, buttons, and a buzzer with Arduino. By the end of this task, you will gain experience in using button state change, implementing debouncing techniques, and coordinating multiple components to represent real-world scenarios.

# Homework 4

The  initial  position  should  be  on  the  DP.  The  currentposition always blinks (irrespective of the fact that the segment is on oroff).  Use the joystick to move from one position to neighbors (see table forcorresponding movement).  Short pressing the button toggles the segmentstate  from  ON  to  OFF  or  from  OFF  to  ON.  Long  pressing  the  buttonresets the entire display by turning all the segments OFF and moving thecurrent position to the decimal point.
